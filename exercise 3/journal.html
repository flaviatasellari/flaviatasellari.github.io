            <p> I went to Domino's Pizza alone. The lady on the counter was very courteous in the way she talked to me. She had a very good smile, and by the time I walked out of the store, I had a very good smile too. </p>
            <p> Not very often you come out of any store happy because of the way you're treated. </p>
